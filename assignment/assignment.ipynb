        "\n",
        "  The \"tidy data standard\" is intended to make initial exploration and analysis of data more efficient, as well as to simplify the development of data analysis tools that can work well together.\n",

        "  3. Read the intro to section 2. What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  The first sentence means that while all tidy datasets have the same structure (variables as columns, observations as rows, etc), messy datasets are all different because their data represents different observations and are often structured differently due to their differing sources.\n",

        "\n",
        "  The five most common problems with messy data sets are column headers are values (not variable names), multiple variables are stored in one column, variables are stored in both rows and columns, multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table, and a single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.\n",
        "\n",
        "  The data in Table 4 are messy because the column headers are values (not variable names) and there are variables stored in both rows and columns.\n",

        "  7. Why, specifically, is table 11 messy but table 12 tidy and \"molten\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "  Table 11 is messy because it has variables in both rows and columns and the element column is not a variable (instead it has the names of variables).\n",
        "\n",
        "  Table 12 is more tidy because the dataset is melted and then casted (unstacked) so that the variables aren't in both columns and rows.\n",

        "  The \"chicken-and-egg\" problem is that if tidy data is only as useful as the tools that work with it, then tidy tools will continue to be linked to tidy data.\n",

How should future large scale surveys be adjusted to best reflect the diversity of the population? Could some of the Census' good practices be adopted more widely to gather richer and more useful data?\n",

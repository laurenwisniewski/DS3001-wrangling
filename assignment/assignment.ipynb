What does this sentence mean: \"Like families, tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.\" What does this sentence mean: \"For a given dataset, it’s usually easy to figure out what are observations and what are variables, but it is surprisingly difficult to precisely define variables and observations in general.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "  The first sentence means that while all tidy datasets have the same structure (variables as columns, observations as rows, etc), messy datasets are all different because their data represents different observations and are often structured differently due to their differing sources.\n",

        "  The five most common problems with messy data sets are column headers are values (not variable names), multiple variables are stored in one column, variables are stored in both rows and columns, multiple types of observational units are stored in the same table, and a single observational unit is stored in multiple tables.\n",
        "\n",
